# Coordinated Activity on Twitter

In recent years, social networks have been leveraged in order to develop influence campaigns. 
These deceptive and manipulative efforts seek to sway public opinion by disseminating fabricated and misleading information, usually with the intent of favoring a particular political side or ideology. 
They take advantage of the discussion that naturally develops around such events to introduce misinformation and target common users.

Rather than being orchestrated by a solitary individual, influence campaigns tend to be sophisticated and coordinated endeavors undertaken by groups of malicious users operating in unison. These nefarious actors exploit a wide array of techniques and tactics.
There is an extended body of research that focuses on the detection of users belonging to influence campaigns.

This repository holds the implementation of state-of-the-art detection methods focused on building similarity networks of users based on different suspicious behavioural traces:
- Fast Retweet (Pacheco et al., 2020)
- Co-Retweet (Pacheco et al., 2021)
- Co-URL (Gabriel  et al., 2023)
- Hashtag Sequence (Pacheco et al., 2021)
- Text Similarity (Pacheco et al., 2020)
